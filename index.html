<h1>Scientists explored creatures formed within microorganisms living in the abdomen.</h1> 
<img src=physician.jpg alt= physician.jpg />
<p>Pennisi E. (2024). ‘’It’s insane: New viruslike entities found in human gut microbes’.  Science. 26 January. Available at: 10.1126/science.znxt3dk (Accessed: 21 March 2024) </p>

<h2>The aim is to find possible effects in microorganisms, and how interactions between microorganism and their environment wound change. The results of exploration will assist on health services for humans as they are surrounded and occupied by microorganisms.</h2>

<p>The biologists collect and analyze massive amounts of genetic sequences from plants, animals, and microbes. They encounter new discoveries. Some of these discoveries may challenge human health practices. Biologists discovered the new virus-like organism recently. This organism occupies the bacteria found in the digestive tract of human. It's genome seems to be ribonucleic acid (RNA) loops in composition. </p>
<p>Scientists do not suspect this obelisk as unhealthy at moment, but they look forward to find how the human genes will be affected by bacteria that contain the discovered obelisks. RNA is known, as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)’s alter ego—conveying protein making recipes encoded in a DNA-based gene outside the cell nucleus that string together a protein’s amino acids. But more than 200 viruses, including those that cause flu, Ebola, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), bypass DNA, having genomes composed only of RNA. Their genomes include sequences encoding the proteins that make up a viral shell and ribosomes, enzymes that let a virus copy its original RNA once inside a cell. </p>
<p>There is debate about viruses being living on non-living organisms.  The cause of debate is the fact that viruses replicate by depending on cells of the organism attacked by viruses. The plant pathologists discovered viroids, including loop of RNA, which was transmittable. This loop of RNA did not have protein shell. Interactions between viroids and plant genomes cause attentiveness to scientists. Those interactions results in some facts in flowers and crops, for example, the deformation and stunting in potatoes. </p>
<p>Some life forms such as animals, and bacteria showed evidence of viroidlike circular RNA genomes. Biologists from Stanford University developed the sophisticated software to help in analysis of genes from microbes found in human. Analysis is performed for proving the RNA sequences imagined to form circles as structure of genetic material in both viroids and viruses. </p>
<p>The Stanford search submitted nearly 30,000 forecasted RNA circles, each consisting of about 1000 bases and likely representing a distinct obelisk. They were unlikely to be real viruses, because RNA viruses typically have many more bases. But some of the obelisk sequences encoded proteins involved in RNA replication, making them more complex than standard viroids. Like viroids, however, obelisks do not seem to encode proteins that make up a shell, further work is needed to see how distinct obelisks are from viroids and other viroidlike particles. </p>
<p>Obelisk sequences were found in 7% of human digestive tract bacteria and in half the bacteria in the human mouth among the human microbial databases examined. The obelisks in microbes from different parts of the body have distinctive sequences.  Because obelisks contain genes that are unlike any discovered so far in other organisms, they comprise a class of diverse RNAs that have colonized, and gone unnoticed in, human, and global microbiomes. </p>

<h1>Digitalization and innovation</h1> 
<img src=digitals.jpg alt= digitals.jpg />
<p>Sandvik. (2023) ‘Ready for the future’.  Sandvik.  18 September.  Available at: https://www.home.sandvik/en/stories/articles/2023/09/ready-for-the-future/ (Accessed: 20 February 2024) </p>

 <h2>Artificial intelligence is investigated continually by Sandvik, the global organisation that provides products and other services to the mining companies. The purpose of this investigation is to advance its services for employees and clients through innovation of technology.</h2>

<p>Artificial Intelligence capabilities has been researched and developed by Sandvik for many years. Rahul Kedia, the head of Sandvik Artificial Intelligence and Automation Centre for Enablement (CFE) says this organisation increased the focus on the advanced technology. </p>
<p>Sandvik is investing outstanding resources for the development and implementation of AI-based systems. Kedia said that Sandvik hires professionals like data scientists who work on variation of AI-based developments. He also mention that the organisation will enable the facilitate thhe usage and adoption of AI and automation across Sandvik business areas and divisions through the foundation of AI and Automation Centre for Enablement. </p>
<p>In order to enable and support the various business areas and divisions to develop services and products the CFE works in close collaboration with them. These services and products will improve efficiency and productivity for customers, and ultimately generate new revenue streams through AI and automation. Kedia said that the crucial role played by CFE is to bring skills, expertise, knowledge and competence sharing from other similar initiatives within Sandvik. </p>
<p>AI is used to identify when the machine is about to fail. The customer is notified to perform certain inspections to fix machine before it fails. Remote Monitoring Service from Sandvik Mining and Rock solutions, one of the first significant AI-enabled services that Sandvik established is already providing value to customers and increasing revenue streams. The service utilises advanced analytic AI models to identify problems in mine equipment before they occur. Mine operators prevent failures through this predictive maintenance. </p>
<p>Esa Mattila, the Global Productivity and Reliability Centre Manager explained that what to do is described when predicting what is going to fail; this method is called prescriptive maintenance.
Connected machines, data stored and accessed from cloud is background of this service that already took place for many years. The AI models and ability to understand their data gives customers visibility of occurrences and how to improve them. </p>
<p>Utilising machines when broken down uses fewer spare parts. Visibility enables improved efficiency and less costs. These also increase number of customers in Remote Monitoring Service. AI can improve efficiency, productivity and supply chain management. It can also assist customers with identification for growth and innovation opportunities. Matilla stated that AI also increases automation of services for customers. The development of Robotic Process Automation has already been added in technologies for business by CFE. Kedia explained that CFE supports the plant in United States (US) with more than 500 processes to determine parts of processes that can be automated. </p>
<p>It is mentioned that AI makes work easy and safe in the environment. It does not take people's jobs as it assumed by other people. AI makes processes sustainable and improves competitiveness for business. Sandvik is looking forward to enable image and speech recognition. Image recognition can help to automate mining equipment to recognise boulders in tunnels while speech recognition is used to make background systems more interactive with human operators. </p>

<h1>There is hope of rich harvesting and business from farmers.</h1>
<img src=businessman.jpg alt= businessman.jpg />
<p>Kriel G. (2024). ‘Farm sales outlook points to positive growth’. Farmer’s weekly.  17 January. Available at: https://www.farmersweekly.co.za/agri-news/south-africa/farm-sales-outlook-points-to-positive-growth/ (Accessed: 18 February 2024) </p>

<h2>Johann Bornman, the chairperson of Agricultural Development Solutions explained that South Africa sold 4 270 farm units in the year 2023. Good rains in summer are advantageous to farmers, so there is hope to sell more units in 2024.</h2>

______

<p>Climate changes that were usually associated with drought in summer rainfall areas cause farmers to fear that production may be affected in this season.  Bornman said that it had been relatively dry until mid-December, but good rains since have created a much more positive outlook for the rest of the season and resulted in many farmers now being open for business and looking for ways to consolidate their positions. </p>
<p>He also explained that logistical challenges and load shedding already affected the sales on farming, and he assumes that upcoming election and political matters might not cause big challenges on farm trades.  Bornman said that big commercial farmers find ways to overcome some of these challenges, but there is only so much you can do, for instance, about logistical challenges at the Cape Town harbour. Failure to deliver fruit on time is having a negative impact on farm margins, which in turn has subdued farm sales in 2023. </p>
<p>Farm subsectors had poor performance in the year 2023. The causes were the highly pathogenic avian influenza in the poultry industries, and the foot-and-mouth disease in the livestock industries.Drought on production was the big problem for many livestock farmers. Those farmers had to manage fair costs in order for their products to be sold in time while farmers also gain profit. </p>
<p>Bornman said that cattle and sheep farmers will be in better position in 2024 if foot-and-mouth disease is not a problem and they are able to export their meat to other countries. Unfortunately, this will also heavily depend on the optimal functioning of our ports. Farm sales in the year 2023 showed the difference that was larger than 600ha category when compared to sales in the year 2022. Number of hectares soled raised from 1,4 million to 1,5 million but sales of that category represented 20% of all transactions. </p>
<p>Drought in various parts of the Karoo took five to seven years. This caused the economic pressure that primarily affected those sales. Farms that are category smaller than 50ha declined in representation of sales from 35% in the year 2022 to 32% in the year 2023.  The size was 69 000ha that accounted for 17% of sales in 2023, which is slightly lower when compared to size of 70 000ha in 2022 for farms ranging from 50ha to 150ha. The percentages of total sales remained similar for the rest of categories. </p>
<p>The hectarage sold in the latter category increased from 142 000ha in 2022 to 150 000ha in 2023. Farms ranging from 300ha to 450ha represented 9% of sales, and those ranging from 150ha to 30 ha represented 15% of sales in 2023.</p>
<p>Jan-Hendrik Fourie, principal property practitioner at Agrisell said that the sentiment over land in general is positive. Land is one of the only investments that can almost double in value in only 10 years, and its value will continue to increase because of the growing need for food security. He explained that load-shedding is one of causes for some purchases that had been held back in the 2022 but then he assumed that customers planned the ways to deal with cost when buying during load-shedding. </p>

<h1>High school learners of the year 2023 showed promising focus on agricultural related studies.</h1>
<img src=farmer.jpg alt= farmer.jpg />
<p>Botha L. (2024) ‘Agriculture takes spotlight in matric class of 2023’. 23 January. Farmer’s weekly. Available at: https://www.farmersweekly.co.za/agri-news/south-africa/agriculture-takes-the-spotlight-in-matric-class-of-2023/ (Accessed: 11 February 2024) </p>

<h2>The agriculture sector has more reason for optimism with the increase in interest in agricultural subjects while the matric class of 2023 has much to celebrate in the increased pass rate.</h2>

_______________

<p>An uptick interest in agriculture subjects have been reported by agricultural schools around the country. The final marks of agricultural sciences, management and technology are good for most students. </p>
There were about 1 500 learners in total, from which 1 000 learners were found studying agricultural subjects at Merensky High School in Tzaneen, Limpopo. This school achieved 99,5% pass rate.Youth is inspired by many successes in agricultural studies after years ago students found not interested in agriculture because of difficulties in land claims.
<p>Students also realise that agriculture is not a subject you learn at school and never use again but it is knowledge you will always use no matter where you are.Farmer's weekly had been told by Karel Schwab, principal that the school, Winterberg Agricultural High School in the Eastern Cape had to extend their agricultural subjects in the 2023 since interest is rising in this area of study. </p>
<p>Spurring interest in agricultural subjects is conversations around own food production. There are far more possibilities for interesting careers across this sector therefore students should also realise that one does not need to own a farm to study agriculture. Most of students obtained the pass rate that is allowed for tertiary study. Learners from Merensky High School obtained 98% pass rate. University of Free State, University of Pretoria and Ellensburg agricultural Training Institute were chosen to take agricultural related studies. </p>
<p>Nine out of fifteenth learners who passed information technology with distinction are interested in following agriculture. The council sets the standard for education training in South Africa and ensures that exams are marked correctly. This follows the fact that the Umalusi Council had marked down the marks for agricultural management and agricultural technology. Marking the exams correctly will optimise the increase in interest in agriculture. </p>

<h1>The strategies necessary for advanced banking and payments in African countries.</h1>
<img src=cash.jpg alt= cash.jpg />
<p>Bizcommunity (2024). ‘The importance of taking uniquely African approach to digital banking and payments’.  Bizcommunity.  29 January. Available at: https://www.bizcommunity.com/article/the-importance-of-taking-a-uniquely-african-approach-to-digital-banking-and-payments-123626a# (Accessed: 15 February 2024) </p>

<h2>The convergence of global payment trends with local innovations to create a dynamic and uniquely African financial ecosystem is witnessed by the continent with its unique challenges and opportunities.</h2>

<p>Chipo Mushwana, executive of emerging innovation at Nedbank Retail, explained that the march towards Africa’s digitalisation is inevitable, and banks need to be at the heart of this transformation, delivering a rich mosaic of digital payment options that are as diverse as they are adaptable. </p>
<p>She noted that the emergence of so-called “super apps” are proving to be one of the primary drivers, and highlighted there is a number of key global trends that are shaping the digital payments landscape on the continent. Communication, commerce, and financial services in a single interface are digital platforms. They have the ability to break down barriers and weave banking seamlessly into the fabric of daily life by unlocking meaningful and sustainable financial inclusion in Africa. </p>
<p>Services that Africans use daily and payments made directly on apps are financial benefits and the core component of the continent's financial ecosystem. Digital wallets play the good role as innovation of e-commerce; they are effective to sustainable economic growth and development. They are trusted for safeguarding transactions for online purchased products and also provide account to save some funds securely. </p>
<p>Other way to maintain economic well-being is hybrid billing. The hybrid billing model enables companies to invoice their customers for a combination of charge types, such as a mix of subscriptions, overages, one-time fees, add-on services, and pay-as-you-go models. In this billing model, customers are charged for the resources they use regularly and for extra or one-time services they request. <p/>
<p>The hybrid billing model offers more flexibility for businesses with complex pricing models, allowing customers to choose the services they need and when they need them. This makes it ideal for customers requiring additional resources without committing to long-term contracts or upfront payments. For example, cloud providers may offer hybrid billing options so their customers can scale up and down their cloud services according to their current requirements. </p>
